Akku is a program for tracking mental health. Here is the workflow:

1. Log entries in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] files with a format similar to [[https://github.com/open-nomie/nomie][nomie]].
2. Parse entries from various sources using ~akku parse ...~.
3. Visualize statistics using ~akku plot ...~.

Here is an example mood plot (tracked via ~#mood(<int>)~):
