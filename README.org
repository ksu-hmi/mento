Akku is a program for tracking mental health. Here is the workflow:

1. Log entries in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] files with a format similar to [[https://github.com/open-nomie/nomie][nomie]].
2. Parse entries from various sources using ~akku parse ...~.
3. Visualize statistics using ~akku ...~.

Here is an example mood plot (tracked via ~#mood(<int>)~) with journal entries:

And here are entry counts:

Akku supports three kinds of Org entries at the moment.

1. [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][Org journal]] encrypted entries.
2. Plain list items in org file whose body looks starts with inactive timestamp
   like this =[2021-02-21 Sun 14:59] ...=
3. [[http://www.orgzly.com/][Orgzly]] entries with =CREATED= property and heading text as =log=.

You can track numerical metrics (like mood), episodes (like attacks), and much
more. A correlation analysis mechanism is work in progress.
