Akku is a program for tracking mental health. It works by capturing notes in a
format similar to [[https://github.com/open-nomie/nomie][nomie]] from various sources. Here is the current list of
sources:

1. [[https://github.com/bastibe/org-journal][Org journal]] encrypted entries.
2. Plain list items in org file whose body starts with inactive timestamp like
   this =[2021-02-21 Sun 14:59] ...=
3. [[http://www.orgzly.com/][Orgzly]] entries with =CREATED= property and heading text as =log=.

Here is an example mood plot (tracked via ~#mood(<int>)~) with journal entries:

[[file:./screens/mood-plot.png]]

Polar hourly plot of mood entries:

[[file:./screens/mood-plot-polar.png]]

And here are entry counts:

You can track numerical metrics (like mood), episodes (like attacks), and much
more. A correlation analysis mechanism is work in progress.

** Usage
For setting up akku, initialize a database by calling ~akku init ./database.db~.
Then add sources manually in the database. You might want to use [[https://sqlitebrowser.org/][sqlitebrowser]]
for this.

+ Org Journal needs ~type~ set to ~ORG_JOURNAL~, and ~path~ set to directory path for
  journal.
+ Orgzly and Org list need ~type~ set to ~ORGZLY~ and ~ORG_LIST~ respectively. ~path~
  points to the file path.

Afterwards, call ~akku ./database.db~ for opening the program. Before opening, the
program will automatically refresh out-of-date sources. You can also force
refresh for all sources by using ~--force-refresh~ flag.

You will also need [[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora][Lora font]] for the tool. Till the time automatic installation
is built, you can use [[https://github.com/lordgiotto/google-font-installer][this tool]] for installation.
